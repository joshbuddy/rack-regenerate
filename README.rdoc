= Rack Regenerate

== Usage

In your rackup file, simply <tt>use Rack::Regenerate</tt>.

If you want a request periodically updated, just send back a header that looks like this:
<tt>X-Cache-Regenerate: [interval in seconds] [number of times to call]</tt>

If for example you sent a header of <tt>X-Cache-Regenerate: 10 20</tt> then the page will be called every 10 seconds 20 times.

If you want a regeneration job to run indefinitely, use -1 for the second argument.
